# D-d-d-Dungeons
D-d-d-Dungeons?! is an isometric roguelike dungeon crawler for mobile, featuring turn-based movement and controls optimized for small touch-screen devices.

The core gameplay is simple: explore randomly generated “dungeons” while battling or evading enemies you encounter, and finding loot such as healing objects and weapons to advance further.

It is “turn-based” in such a way that enemies can only move or attack when you move or attack. This provides an element of strategy, as players must think carefully about what actions to take in order to minimise damage from enemies and traps.
